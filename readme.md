# crs-binding

This is a dependency free binding engine for web client development.  
The focus is on web technology standards as far as possible.

1. Making use of ES6+ ish syntax
1. Using HTML5 templates
1. Web component support either vanilla or using bindable element.

A core focus of crs-binding is to manage binding or context data, responding to those context changes.  
There is a clear separation between component properties and binding data so that they can operate in isolation of each other.

Please note that crs binding is still under active development as we are using it in an enterprise scale application.   
Changes are made as we require new features or discover usability issues and bugs.  
At this point of time the binding engine is stable.   
We do not anticipate any breaking changes though more features will be added.  

## Installing

```
npm install crs-binding@latest
```

## Documentation
Documentation comes in two main forms.

1. [Written Documentation](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-binding-documentation)
1. [Sample Application](https://crs-binding-examples.web.app/)

The sample application is [opensource](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-binding-examples) but also provides links per sample to source for you to review.

## Testing
Tests are written in both unit and puppeteer tests.
Unit testing are used for core mechanics but DOM features are tested using puppeteer.

For the puppeteer tests to run you must have an active server running on port 8000.  

## Getting Started

One of the easiest ways to get started is to create a sample application where everything is setup for you.

Here are two github templates you can use.

1. [spa starter](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-spa-starter)
1. [application starter](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-application-template)

The sample application uses the application starter.  
The difference between the two is that the application starter has a menu included.

Once on your hard drive, remember to run `npm install` in the commandline to install all the dependencies.

## Install and using

If you don't want to use an existing template, you can easily set up your own project.

1. install crs binding using npm `npm install crs-binding@latest`
1. include it in your project `<script type="module" src="./node_modules/crs-binding/crs-binding.js"></script>`

Once you have included the library, crsbinding is registered on globalThis for usage.  
You can look at the [sample application](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-binding-examples) for details.

## Package

When installing crs binding you will notice that the library is bundled into one file but not minified.  
This gives the end user a bit of flexibility around how they want to handle deploying crs binding with their application.
