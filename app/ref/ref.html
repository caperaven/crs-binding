                Using the binding engine to set a property referencing to a element in the view.
                This means that you can define a property on the binding context and property will point to the element.
                In this example we are setting a div to be set on the binding context using a property by name of "changeElement".
                The binding context then set's the text content.

                You don't need to worry about removing the property as the binding engine will clean it up once the context is disposed.
